- **API**: Centralized HTTP request handling
- **Hooks**: Reusable React logic
- **Utils**: Helper functions

This structure follows React best practices:
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI logic separated from data fetching
- **Reusability**: Components can be used across multiple pages
- **Maintainability**: Organized structure makes code easy to navigate
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new pages and components

The frontend communicates with the backend through the API modules, providing a clean interface between UI and backend services. All components follow React patterns and best practices for modern web development.
